# binance-tradingbot.py
This code uses Binance API to create Buy and Sell orders based on MACD(5,13,2) on 3hr chart, which is a highly profitable strategy.
You must directly enter your API Key and Secret in the code on lines 43 and 44
This code is a WIP. Although the strategy is profitable and the bot works fine, there are many GUI and strategy updates to come!
